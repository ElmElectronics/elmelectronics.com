</div><div class="contenttext"><!-- *********************** the page content starts here *************************** --><h3>Frequently Asked Questions
</h3><p>Here are a few of the more common questions that we were often asked. As we are no longer an operating company, we have removed a few that no longer have meaning.
</p><div class="myblockquote"><p class="question">I do not want to buy an ELM327 scantool with a clone chip in it. Can you provide a list of customers that use genuine ELM327 chips in their product?
</p><div class="myblockquote">No - sorry. Even if we could share customer information (we do not), we could not guarantee that a particular customer always uses our product. Simply buying some ICs from us is no guarantee that they do not also sell clone products.<p>If you want to be sure that a particular scan tool uses a genuine ELM327 integrated circuit, ask the vendor or manufacturer. Perhaps obtain their assurance that your money will be refunded if you are not completely satisfied.
</p>
</div><p class="question">Do you license portions of your code?
</p><div class="myblockquote">No. Elm Electronics does not license the code to any of our products.
</div><p class="question">Do you have any retailers or distributors in my country?
</p><div class="myblockquote">No - we only offer our products via the web, and do not have distributors. This helps to keep our costs down, so we can in turn keep the prices low. All orders must be made over the Internet, through our web site.
</div><p class="question">What is your return policy?
</p><div class="myblockquote">Returns are not accepted. As experienced electronics hobbyists know, mistakes can happen when you are building a circuit. Occasionally circuits are severely overstressed by excessive voltages or currents, and although they may not fail right away, they could eventually die prematurely due to the stress. We cannot know what an IC has been subjected to, so can never resell one if it were to be returned. This is common practice in the electronics industry - we are just being consistent.
</div><p class="question">Do you do custom designs?
</p><div class="myblockquote">No, sorry but we are a small business, and do not have the resources required to develop and maintain custom products.
</div><p class="question">Can I phone you to ask a question?
</p><div class="myblockquote">No, you can not - we no longer have a telephone help line, and we have closed the email accounts.<br />
</div><a name="privacy" id="privacy"></a><p class="question">What is your Privacy Policy?
</p><div class="myblockquote"><p>Any information that you provide to us remains confidential. Other than passing on your information to Stripe for credit card authorization (through an encrypted portal) your information is never shared by us with, nor sold to another party.
